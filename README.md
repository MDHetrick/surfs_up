# Surf and Ice Cream Shop
## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide detailed weather information for a client who is considering opening a surf and ice cream shop in O'ahu. The detailed weather analysis will provide information to help the client determine if the business will be sustainable year-round.

## Analysis

### Results
The following comparisons can be made using the descriptive statistics (shown below):
 - The mean temp in is 74.94 in June and 71.04 in Dec
 - The min temp is 64 in June and 56 in Dec
 - The max temp is 85 in June and 83 in Dec

#### Additional queries
Queries were performed to obtain June and December precipitation statistics

A query was done to obtain the overall temperature statistics

Next, queries were done to obtain the temperature statistics for each month and results were graphed.

Finally, descriptive statistics were obtained for temperature mean, min, and max for each month.

**Results - Additional Queries:**
- The max precipitation was 4.43 for June and 6.42 for December
- The mean precipitation was 0.23 for June and 0.34 for December
- The 75th percentile for precipitation was 0.24 for June and 0.33 for December
- The monthly mean temperatures throughout the year range from 68.73 to 76.41
- The monthly minimum temperatures range from 53.00 to 65.00 
- The monthly maximum temperatures range from 81.00 to 87.00 
- There is the greatest variability in the minimum temperature with a standard deviation of 4.43
- 
### Summary
While there is some variability in temperatures from month to month, the max temp for each month is above 80 degrees, and the mean temp for each month is almost 70 degrees. While the temperature minimums vary the most by month, they still remain quite moderate. The max precipitation for June and December is large, but the mean and 75th percentile are less than 0.35 for both months, suggesting that there may be a couple days each month with significant precipitation, but the remainder of the days are potentially drier. 

Based on this analysis and the assumption that moderate weather is desirable, the weather in O'ahu should be conducive to sustaining a surf and ice cream shop all year.
